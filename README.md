## Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Data Cleaning & EDA
- Missing values handled, outliers checked, new features (Age, Tenure) engineered, converted to datetime
- Cleaned Date:

## Key Insights

- **Champions** and **Loyal Customers** yield the highest campaign ROI; target with premium offers and loyalty programs.
- **Potential Loyalists** respond best to Campaigns 3 & 4; nurture for higher value.
- **Lower-value segments** (At Risk, Hibernating, New) require low-cost, automated re-engagement.
- Predictive model achieves ROC-AUC of 0.80; top predictors include recent activity, wine spend, and web/catalog engagement.

---

## Business Recommendations

- Prioritise premium campaigns for Champions and Loyal Customers (especially Campaigns 4 & 5)
- Use targeted, nurture offers for Potential Loyalists
- Employ cost-effective re-engagement for lower-value segments
- Apply model predictions to maximise ROI in future campaigns

## Assumptions & Limitations

- RFM and response at customer level (not transaction)
- No timestamped transactions, limiting some churn analysis
- Model performance can be improved with more data or other algorithms
